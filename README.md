# Gladius
A simple online MMORPG which players can create an account and manage their own gladiators.  Each player starts with 50 gold which can be used to create gladiators or upgrade their current gladiators.   Each player is able to fight other player's gladiators in the arena or can choose 3 difficulties of AI fights.  Each fight is similiar to Top Trumps as each gladiator has 3 stats (Strength, Stamina and Agility), one of these stats are chosen at random and the player with the highest number in this stat wins and the other gladiator is killed(deleted).
When a player has no gold left they can go to the sea and wage war against other online players in a simple ship combat game, with each cannonball hit giving that player more gold, the player can then cash out their winnings and create more gladiators.
Also included in this is an anonymous notice board where players can speak to other online players in a synchronous chat board, it was chosen to be anonymous to maintain the feeling of the game being set in the past.
I would've liked to find a way to allow players more control over their gladiator when in the arena and introduce more types of fights e.g 2 vs 1, 3 vs 3 etc.
